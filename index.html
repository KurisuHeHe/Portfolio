          A web developer focused around front end development and designing
          unique web pages. I’m currently enrolled in a fullstack coding
          bootcamp at Thinkful and have a strong background in sales/technical
          support. A challenging environment where I'm constantly working with
          others and learning from them is where I thrive. Truly looking forward
          to assimilating myself with new technologies such as React, Node.js,
          etc on this long journey ahead.

          For as long as I can remember, tech has always been a personal passion
          of mine. Growing up, my friends and I would spend hours searching the
          web for computer parts we wanted to buy. Although we lived in the
          Bronx and didn't have much, we eventually created one from scratch
          together. Definetly one of my favorite memories and one that surely
          made me appreciate just how important it is to surround yourself with
          like minded inviduals.
