          As a web developer, my expertise is focused around front end
          development and designing unique web pages. I’m currently enrolled in
          a fullstack coding bootcamp at Thinkful and mostly looking forward to
          learning new skills such as (node.js, react, etc).

          Tech has been a personal passion of mine for as long as I can
          remember. Growing up I would spend my weekends going to game stores
          with friends and just enjoyed talking to people about how new games
          were being developed. At one point I even started designing my own and
          dreamed that someday I could bring it to life. Now as a developer, I’m
          amazed by just how much you can accomplish with a few lines of simple
          code. Even more, the fact that every day is a new learning experience
          and will continue to be so.
